# Kapua data model

This document describes basics about data model behind Kapua services.  
Each service has its own data base schema. For example: User service is only concerned about schema based on
table **usr_user**.

Following chapters represent data from perspective of system as a whole.

Column data of each entity is not described in detail. This detail is available as part of database creation scripts.
